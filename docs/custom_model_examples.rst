Custom models and datasets
=============

In the following sections we provide examples of using LUX with custom models and datasets.

The example shows how to handle categorical variables in LUX

.. code-block:: python

    from lux.lux import LUX
    from sklearn import datasets
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn import svm
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd



Below, the example of how to use custom, more complex model is provided (e.g. Deep Neural Network).

.. code-block:: python

    from lux.lux import LUX
    from sklearn import datasets
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn import svm
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
